## Topics

### Follow-up from Previous Meeting

**TSC Summary:** No action items from the previous meeting, as the last meeting was mostly focused on v10 planning.

### Statuses

* **@nzakas:** Spent time writing up the AI usage policy and investigating what it would take to convert eslint.org to use Astro. Personal note: Mom is in the hospital, which may affect availability.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Mostly reviewing PRs and triaging issues.
* **@fasttime:** Mostly busy reviewing issues and PRs. Started preparing an RFC for the `--base-path` option.

### Availability Next Two Weeks

* **@nzakas:** Availability is uncertain due to family situation. Aiming for 0.5 hours per weekday but no guarantees.
* **@mdjermanovic:** Expects to be available 1-1.5h each day.
* **@fasttime:** Will be available 7-9 hours per week.

### RFC Duty Update

* This week: @fasttime
* February 23: @mdjermanovic
* March 2: @nzakas

**Note:** The order was initially swapped but corrected during the meeting. @mdjermanovic volunteered to take next week given @nzakas's uncertain availability.

### [Issue #20508: Change Request: Update Ajv to 8.18.0](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20508)

**TSC Summary:** Ajv has a new CVE (CVE-2025-69873) and ESLint is being flagged by security tooling. ESLint currently uses Ajv v6.12.4. The request is to upgrade to Ajv v8.18.0 or otherwise mitigate the security warning, even though it's not exploitable in ESLint.

**Discussion Points:**
- There is work in progress to backport the fix to Ajv v6: [PR #2590](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/pull/2590)
- However, an opt-in solution may not address security scanner warnings
- @nzakas started a Copilot session to see if it could figure out how to upgrade Ajv without breaking the ecosystem
- Copilot created [PR #20523](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20523) to upgrade Ajv from v6 to v8 with draft-04 schema backward compatibility
- Previous attempt at upgrading to Ajv v8 ([PR #13911](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13911)) used the `ajv-draft-04` package, which might be useful for the new attempt
- The number of plugins in the repo will make a good smoke test

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to:
- See if Copilot can properly upgrade Ajv to v8
- If successful, release as early as next week and backport to v9
- If unsuccessful, consider either waiting for an Ajv v6 fix or forking Ajv
- If forking, the team would remove the RegExp constructor to make security scanners happy
- The release is not critical for tomorrow's scheduled release, but could potentially be released Monday or Tuesday next week

**Action Items:**
- @mdjermanovic will review the PR after the meeting

### [Issue #20518: Change Request: Update Minimatch to v10.2.1](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20518)

**TSC Summary:** Minimatch has declared a high vulnerability on versions <10.2.1 (GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26). The request is to upgrade minimatch in various ESLint packages.

**Discussion Points:**
- Package.json files for ESLint v10.x have already been updated: [PR #20519](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20519) and [PR #376](https://github.com/eslint/rewrite/pull/376)
- The fix is being backported to minimatch v3 (which v9 uses): [Issue #275](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/issues/275#issuecomment-3929312587)
- The problem is with `@eslint/config-array` for v9, as there's no infrastructure to release updates for previous major versions
- Manual publishing would raise alerts when a package previously published with provenance is published without
- Asking everyone to edit their lock files is not a good solution
- Overrides in eslint's package.json work locally but don't affect published packages

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to:
- Upgrade v9 when the backported minimatch is ready
- @nzakas will investigate adding infrastructure for publishing a previous major release line of `@eslint/config-array`
- This will be useful in the future if other packages need patching
- The infrastructure is tricky because it's a monorepo, requiring different branches for each package, but it's doable

**Action Items:**
- @nzakas will look at setting up infrastructure for publishing previous major versions

### [Issue #19920: Change Request: Set Minimum Supported TypeScript Version to v5.3](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/19920)

**TSC Summary:** ESLint recently had to fix a regression in the v9.x line related to TypeScript compatibility ([Issue #20495](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20495)). To reduce the risk of similar issues during the v10.x cycle, it would be helpful to define a minimum supported TypeScript version for ESLint and for the dependencies used in type definitions.

**TSC Question:** Should we set the minimum supported TypeScript version to 5.3, as proposed?

**Alternative Options:**
- TypeScript >= 5.0: The earliest version compatible with types in ESLint v10.0.0
- TypeScript >= 5.9: TypeScript 5.9.3 was the latest version when ESLint v10.0.0 was released

**Discussion Points:**
- This would involve adding a note to the docs and adding tests for the baseline TypeScript version
- Would also apply to other packages like `@eslint/core`, `@eslint/plugin-kit`, etc.
- ESLint v10 and all of its immediate dependencies would share the same TypeScript support level (similar to Node.js support)
- At minimum, this applies to dependencies used in the types

**Resolution:** The TSC agreed to set the minimum supported TypeScript version for ESLint v10 to TypeScript v5.3.

### Scheduled Release for February 20th, 2026

**Packages to Release for v9.x:**
- `@eslint/js` v9.39.3
- `eslint` v9.39.3
- Reason: Bug fix was merged

**Packages to Release for v10.x:**
- `eslint/js` monorepo packages (including [PR #728](https://github.com/eslint/js/pull/728) - eslint-scope 9.1.1)
- `eslint/rewrite` monorepo packages
- `eslint` v10.0.1

**Action Items:**
- @mdjermanovic will do the release on February 20th

**Note:** @nzakas had to leave the meeting early at this point.
