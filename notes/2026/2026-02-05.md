### V10.0.0 Release Planning

**TSC Summary:** The team reviewed the readiness for the final v10.0.0 release scheduled for February 6th.

**Discussion Points:**
- All PRs are prepared and have at least one approval
- Release tasks are documented in two issues:
  - [Issue #20326](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20326) - Revert temporary changes (not urgent, can be done after release)
  - [Issue #20459](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/20459) - Prepare final v10.0.0 release (important for the release)
- Some PRs can be merged in advance to reduce work during release time
- @mdjermanovic tested the release process locally and everything seemed fine
- @mdjermanovic will not be available on February 6th

**PRs to Merge in Advance:**
- [PR #20452](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20452) - Link checker PR (safe to merge now)
- [PR #20453](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20453) - Link checker PR (safe to merge now)
- [PR #20466](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20466) - Likely safe to merge now (CI passing)
- [PR #20467](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/20467) - Likely safe to merge now (CI passing)

**PRs to Wait Until Release Time:**
- 3 remaining PRs should wait (1 right before release, 2 right after)

**Release Details:**
- For `eslint` release: `RELEASE_TYPE` should be `latest`, `RELEASE_BRANCH` is `main`
- For `@eslint/js` release: `RELEASE_TYPE` should be `patch` (releasing 10.0.1 to skip already published 10.0.0), `RELEASE_BRANCH` is `main`

**Resolution:** The TSC confirmed readiness for the v10.0.0 release on February 6th.

**Action Items:**

  - Do the release on February 6th about an hour after meeting time
  - File an issue with EasyCLA to add ESLint Bot commits as an exception ([Infrastructure Issue #100](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/infrastructure/issues/100))
